            The modern citizen in most countries around the world has access to the near unlimited source of useful and applicable public information - the internet. As useful and transformative as the internet is, it comes with its fair share of problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Protection of personal information and oneâ€™s online identity is one of the most relevant and pressing of these issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Hide your IP address</h3>
        <p>
            There are many ways to hide your public address, which acts as your access point to the internet and your network identity. VPNs are frequently advertised tools that change the direction of your entire internet connection to make sure it reaches the destination with a different IP address. VPNs are also great for avoiding surveillance on public networks because created tunnels encrypt transmitted information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want more flexibility, change your IP address with proxy servers. With pre-built apps, browser extensions, or simply setting up changes in your device's settings, you can choose which segments of your internet connection will travel through and adopt an identity of a proxy server.
        </p>
        <p>To avoid tracking, not just from tech companies, but also stop the disruption of hackers and cybercriminals, avoid free proxy servers at all times! While the free service is always more attractive, even with good location choices, you will use an overcrowded server that will blunt your internet speed and may expose you to blacklisted websites.</p>
        <p>Only go for datacenter proxies from legitimate proxy server providers. You can also choose more secure residential addresses to make sure nobody knows you are using a fake IP address. </p>
        <P>Only go for datacenter proxies from legitimate proxy server providers. You can also choose more secure residential addresses to make sure nobody knows you are using a fake IP address. </P>
        <p>If your browsing sessions use bots or other automated tools, try rotating proxies to keep adopting different IPs at predetermined intervals. With the market full of legitimate providers, you will have large pools of datacenter proxy addresses and with the help of dedicated customer support you will be able to enjoy the service to the fullest. While these tools will not eliminate all weaknesses for tracking, internet users that use them to hide segments of private data will enjoy a far more secure browsing experience that limits the exposure of their online identity and their personal data as well.</p>
